How to use my python shelf.

Step 1. Download and save the folder wherever you would like
Step 2. Edit the .json file and change the directory to wherever the overall folder is located (directory should end in /EF_Shelf)
Step 3. Locate Houdini's resources, then copy the .json file into the 'packages' folder. Below are where you will find them (note that houdini version will change) 
    Windows: c:/Users/<yourusername>/Documents/houdini19.5
    OSX: ~/Library/Preferences/houdini/19.5
    Linux: ~/houdini19.5
